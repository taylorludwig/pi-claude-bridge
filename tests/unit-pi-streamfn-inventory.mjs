/**
 * Which pi modules can drive our provider.
 *
 * Anything pi hands a `streamFn` can route an LLM call through the registered
 * provider — this one — carrying a system prompt we never recorded. Branch
 * summarization did exactly that and nobody noticed until it started failing
 * turns, because a behavioural contract test can only probe the entry points we
 * already know about; it structurally cannot find the one we don't.
 *
 * So inventory the source instead. Claude Code is closed and has to be probed,
 * but pi ships readable JS in node_modules, and a new consumer showing up there
 * is exactly the thing we want to hear about at bump time rather than from a
 * user. Read the *installed* dist, not reference-code/pi-mono, which lags for
 * the same reason AGENTS.md distrusts claude-code-rip.
 *
 * If this fails: a pi upgrade added or moved a streamFn consumer. Work out
 * whether it can reach a bridge model, and either handle it (the way
 * `session_before_compact` and `session_before_tree` are taken over) or add it
 * below with a note on why it is harmless.
