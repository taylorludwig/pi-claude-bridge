# Prompt cache test across a mid-conversation git transition. Manual: run directly
# (tests/int-cache-git.sh), never wired into `npm test` — costs ~2 min of real-API
# Haiku per run.
#
# Variant of tests/int-cache.sh. Same harness, same thresholds, but the pi/Claude
# Code process cwd is a throwaway git repo created here, and the conversation
# contains a real `git add -A && git commit` run by the agent (working-tree change
# + new commit) followed by more turns that force reads of the whole history.
#
# The question is empirical: Claude Code's `claude_code` preset embeds a gitStatus
# snapshot, and CC 2.1.280 moves a cache_control ttl=1h breakpoint between turns.
# Do Anthropic cache reads survive a commit boundary, or collapse at it?
#
# Cache thresholds are copied verbatim from int-cache.sh. If `includeGitInstructions:
# false` stops stripping the git snapshot, the commit becomes a real prompt mutation
# and this test must fail rather than pass with loosened numbers -- so a collapse is
# reported loudly, with the failing turn's hit rate, instead of patched out.
